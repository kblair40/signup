TODOS:
    4. manage loading state in FormContainer;
    5. If confirm password is invalid, then password is updated to match 
        confirm password, set confirm password to use valid styles
            - This is mostly done.  The case that needs fixing is if password is updated        
                to match confirm password, but then again changed to not match confirm password.
                Confirm password is not updating to invalid styles
    6. Email Address already in use is needed as an error message on signup form.
        - Probably other errors are needing to be displayed
        - See if firebase can send list of users and user info
            - I'll probably have to push user email addresses to realtime db and check there on email input blur
                - render error message if email input by user is in realtime db
